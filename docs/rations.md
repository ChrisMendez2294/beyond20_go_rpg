# Give rations to this wandering Tiefling 

Thank you for wanting to support me in my adventures!

Beyond20 and the other D&D related software that I've released in the recent months have been sponsored by the generous contributions of my patrons.

In order to help support the continued development of this extension (and more)! Please pledge to my [Patreon](https://patreon.com/kakaroto) or sponsor me on [Github](https://github.com/sponsors/kakaroto).

As a patron or sponsor, you will get access to exclusive software and other perks. You can read the full patreon/github page bio for more information on who I am and what I do.

If however, you do not want to use Patreon or Github Sponsors or don't want to pledge on them for any reason, but still want to support this project financially, you can do so by buying me a ration on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/kakaroto) using [PayPal](https://paypal.me/KaKaRoTo) or a credit card (no signup necessary).
