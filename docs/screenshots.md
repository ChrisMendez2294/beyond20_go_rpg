### Note: These videos and most of the images are over a year old, the extension has evolved immensely since then, but I always lack the time to update the images and videos here.
### Please keep that in mind and if anyone is willing to make new and nicer videos and/or screenshots, let me know.

I've made a [video tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRyB7qPEyKw) of all the features of Beyond20 v0.1.

If you don't have an entire 15 minutes of your life to sacrifice to my boring video, I've also done a much quicker demo of the most important features [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHtR9hsbzP4)

If you don't even have 2 minutes to spend watching that, then here are some screenshots to show you just how amazing Beyond20 is (**click to zoom**):

[![s1](images/screenshots/feature-equipment-attack.png)](images/screenshots/feature-equipment-attack.png)

![up](images/up-arrow.png){:height="16px"} This shows the "Beyond20" roll button and "Display in Roll20" button that get added to the side panels, as well as the Roll20 chat showing a class Feature display, an equipment item, a roll from clicking on the dice in the potion's description, and finally an attack of a multi-damage weapon.

A "Display spell card on roll20" button is also available, which displays the spell card when selected. The spell card is shown as it appears in Roll20 on the left.
